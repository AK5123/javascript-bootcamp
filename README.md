In this 6.5 hours long Javascript Bootcamp, I will train you with the most important javascript concepts so that you can start building websites and prepare for your upcoming front-end interviews.

I will try to explain things in a simple but effective way to make you understand and remember these concepts.

You can also download all the code snippets used in this Bootcamp along with all the cheatsheets.

The video has been tagged with chapters ( timestamps ) if you want to jump to different sections.
